Z-wave Technology
    - Z-wave master device will communicate with Z-wave stack through UART.
    - Controller have access to program memory of Z-wave master device through SPI (for upgrading Z-wave master device).
    - Controller have access to exeternal memory of Z-wave master device through SPI (for updating Z-wave master application content).
    - through SPI only we can access one at a time.

    - Few command class implementation from master device & slave devices.
        - with reference to Z-wave (from sigma) command classes are implemented.
    - firmware upgrade tool for slave devices.
        - using firmware upgrade command lass slave devices are updated.
            - cloud server will send upgrade commad to Z-Wave master device by sending firmware file path.
            - Validated downloaded I-hex file. 
            - After file validation Z-wave master stack will initiate firmware upgrade process of slave device.
                - Send request to slave for firmware upgrade which includes check sum of I-hex file data and wait for ack from slave .
                - On positive ack all firmware file content will be send.
                - slave will validate I-hex file data using check sum calculation.
                - and status will be replied back to Z-wave master stack.
            - upgrade status will be replied back to server.
    - Z-wave flasher tool to upgrade master device.
        - cloud server will send upgrade commad to Z-Wave master device by sending firmware file path.
        - Validated downloaded I-hex file. 
        - Z-wave flaher tool will initiated.
        - Enable programming mode of Z-wave master device.
        - write data to flash through sram of Z-wave master device.
            - 
        - reset Z-wave master and start new firmware.
    
Watchdog service
    Things done in Watchdog service
        - Watchdog functionality that is reset Watchdog timer.
        - resource monitoring
            - monitoring any resource that is logs size or ram usage.
                - if logs size increased than pre-defined size then logbackup will be executed.
                - if ram usage is more then system will be rebooted.
        - service monitoring
            - through socket any process can be monitored using ping command.
            - if service/ process failed to ping then apropriate action will be taken.
            
Buildroot 
    Used for recovery rootfs
    - recovery rootfs has minimal fuctionalities
        - connection manager
        - updating operational kernel or rootfs.

linaro rootfs
    used for operational rootfs.
